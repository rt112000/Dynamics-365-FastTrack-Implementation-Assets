# Scenario details
![Better Together B2B Sales Flow](B2BSalesFlow.png)

### Personas
**Mona**: A Buyer at Northwest Traders, tasked to find new supplier for surfboards as they expand their assortments of items.

**Daisy**: A Sales Associate at Adventure Work, follows up on leads and generates sales Opportunities.


Mona has been tasked to find a new supplier for surfboards as they look to expand their assortment in 2023. Mona has done extensive research and has landed on the Adventure Works e-commerce site. 
 
She believes the surfboards that Adventure Works manufactures will resonate with the Northwind Traders shopper. She would like to further investigate a buying relationship with Adventure Works, so she submits a request on the website with her contact information.

After Mona's request is submitted on the Dynamics 365 Commerce B2B site, the lead information is systematically added to Dynamics 365 Sales. Sales Accelerator capabilities intelligently route and assign the lead to Daisy Phillips for follow-up. 

After meeting with Mona, Daisy updates the Lead record to a Qualified state, which also systematically creates the opportunity record that Daisy will use to track the remaining progress of this sales opportunity.

Daisy creates a collaboration space to work with Adventure Works team members right from Sales.
The team works with live account details from Dynamics 365 Sales within the collaboration space so that everyone view and collaborate on the opportunity together.

After collaborating with team members she updates the opportunity as Won. Marking the opportunity to Won status triggers an automated email to Mona providing her with her logon credentials.

After she is logged in with her Northwind Trader purchasing credentials, she sees the agreed prices.

This showcases how Dynamics 365 Applications: Commerce, Sales, and Viva Sales work together and with Microsoft Teams throughout the B2B onboarding process.
