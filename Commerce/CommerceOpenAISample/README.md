# Create a sample product discovery AI chat assistant app using Azure Open AI service and Dynamics 365 Commerce

Product discovery sample app. The app responds to product inquiries in natural language using CSU APIs and Fabric SQL endpoint.

The app uses AI [function calling](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/function-calling?tabs=python) to fetch data from CSU and Fabric based on the prompt and responds in natural language.

- Reads product data from CSU
- Reads product data from Fabric SQL endpoint
- Uses Open AI chat completion
- Responds in natural text

# Pre-requisites

1. An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/ai-services/)
2. Access granted to Azure OpenAI in the desired Azure subscription
3. [Python 3.8 or later version](https://www.python.org/).If you're using a Linux client machine, see Install the ODBC driver.
4. An Azure OpenAI Service resource with a gpt-35-turbo(0613) model deployed. For more information about model deployment, see the [resource deployment guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal).
5. Install Conda [Installing on Windows â€” conda 24.5.1.dev19 documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html)
6. [Link to fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/data-platform/azure-synapse-link-view-in-fabric)
7. Visual Studio Code with the Python extension

# Setup

1. Update the env file with resource details(CSU, OPENAI, Fabric SQL Endpoint)
2. Run `conda env create -f environment.yml`
3. To get details of environment `conda info --envs`.
4. Run `conda activate OpenAISampleApp`
5. Select the OpenAISampleApp env python interpreter in VS code.
6. Install all the packages with `conda env update --file environment.yml --prune`
7. Create view variantinfoview in Fabric using SQL endpoint.
8. Hit F5 to run.
